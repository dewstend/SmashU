INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (1,'Palus counter underwhelming?','Dont you think that her counter is kinda subpar In comparison to everyone else?\\n\\nI mean, on activation the hitbox is a very small area in front of her and sometimes leave you even in a worst position because you can get counter countered when she wiffs the hit.\\n\\nAlso the effect is sub par. It kills but at very high %s or after countering an inmensely poweful hit (all counters do this anyway but way earlier)\\n\\nI would not mind the power if the hitbox was bigger tho, or at least had a better animation more fitting for a goddes.\\n\\nLook at corrins counter for example.\\n\\nPalutenas counter doesnt need to be as mounstrous, but if the counter acted as a hitbox around her, with the same launching power and dmg, i would be pleased with it.\\n\\nRight now i feel it uninspired and weak. If she could receive a buff, this would be probably my first and maybe onlye wish.\\n\\nThoughts?','Palutena',0),(2,'Possible New Palutena Kill Confirms','I decided to go to training mode for a little bit and I found some neat kill confirms with Palutena.\\n\\nNair (first hit) to Up Smash at 100%\\nNair (first hit) to Side Smash at 100%\\nNair (first hit) to Up Tilt at about 135%\\nNair (first hit) to Side Tilt at around 120% when near the ledge.\\nDown throw to Dair at around 80%\\n\\nThe first two are better for bigger and heavier foes while the third one works better for lightweight characters. The fourth one is not super useful, but I think it is neat. The fifth one is just great for style but really difficult to pull off. These kill confirms might already have been shared or discovered and if they have been, I am sorry. These were just some neat combos that I discovered on my own while practicing with Palutena in training mode that I thought I would share with you guys.','Palutena',0);
